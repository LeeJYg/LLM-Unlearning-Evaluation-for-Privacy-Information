# LLM-Unlearning-for-Privacy-Information
This repository is dedicated to exploring **LLM unlearning**, focusing on privacy risks and strategies to effectively and efficiently "forget" specific data from large language models.

---

## Overview
Large Language Models (LLMs) pose privacy challenges due to their ability to memorize and regenerate sensitive information. **LLM unlearning** seeks to mitigate these risks while maintaining model performance. This repository provides:
- A concise framework for understanding LLM unlearning.
- Guidelines for privacy attack creation and unlearning evaluation.
- Insights into open challenges and future directions.

## Key Topics
### Privacy Risks in LLMs
- **Membership Inference Attacks (MIA):** Identifying training data.
- **Data Reconstruction Attacks:** Extracting sensitive content.
- **Privacy Regulation Compliance:** Addressing data deletion requests (e.g., GDPR).

### Unlearning Techniques
- **Fine-Tuning Adjustments:** Retraining on modified datasets to erase sensitive data.
- **Selective Forgetting:** Targeted removal of data contributions.
- **Utility Preservation:** Maintaining overall model functionality.

### Evaluation Methods
- **Unlearning Effectiveness:** Assessing removal completeness.
- **Privacy Metrics:** Measuring resilience against adversarial attacks.
- **Model Utility:** Evaluating performance trade-offs in downstream tasks.
